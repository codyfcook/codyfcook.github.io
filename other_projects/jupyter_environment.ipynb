    "* The text editor `vim` is painful to learn, but incredibly powerful once you invest the time. Perhaps that will be my next guide. \n",
    "* Use `git` to manage your code so that it's easy to use your code on many servers (and locally). And backup your data, especially if you don't manage the server you're using -- don't trust that your code and data won't be deleted! \n",
