    "US cities show remarkable sorting by gender -- men and women locate such that some neighborhoods skew strongly female while others skew strongly male. Consider the map of Cook County, IL (Chicago) shown in the figure below. Residents under the age of 18 appear to be randomly spread across the city, as one might expect given the coin flip that occurs for each birth. For adults, however, there is clear clustering in certain neighborhoods. The magnitudes are large; in the South and West of the city, many census tracts have up to 30% more women than men. \n",

    "This is perhaps surprising and leads to many questions. Why do men and women live in different areas? Is it sorting for certain amenities, such as schools or access to restaurants? More importantly, how does it relate to economic outcomes/opportunities? Can any of the gaps in outcomes, like the gender wage gap, be explained by differences in proximity to opportunity? Are men and women equally geographically mobile and equally likely to move “up” to “better” areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent that residential locations affect economic outcomes, and the differences in men and women's locations are correlated with those outcomes, these differences in locations may explain gender differences in outcomes such as income. Past research has demonstrated the importance of residential location in determining economic opportunity and outcomes. The economic consequences of racial segregation have been well-studied; in general, studies find significantly worse outcomes for those living in highly segregated neighborhoods ([Cutler et al., 1999](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/250069#metadata_info_tab_contents); [Cutler and Glaeser, 1997](https://www.nber.org/papers/w13082)). A classic example of the effects of residential location is the Moving to Opportunity experiment in Boston: vouchers to move families from high-poverty projects to lower-poverty neighborhoods had large effects on young children, increasing college attendance and earnings and reducing single parenthood rates  ([Chetty et al., 2016](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150572)). The experiment had less notable results for the adults: while mental, physical, and subjective well-being were greatly improved, there were no significant effects on earnings or unemployment ([Katz et al., 2001](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/116/2/607/1904187); [Kling et al., 2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2007.00733.x)). More recently, [van Dijk (2019)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nxOHg4uKgVtRiyNjCjMq4ScsJo8uX97F/view) shows that a lottery for public housing in the Netherlands had positive labor market effects for poor individuals moving into high-income neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I make no attempt to answer the *why* and simply show that this fact is ubiquous across cities, persistent over time, and driven by single adults. I also show that areas with more women are lower income, more racially segregated, have more educated women relative to the men, and have more single mothers. "

    "This project documents an interesting fact: single men and women live in different locations, and these locations tend to be lower income and more racially segregated. \n",
    "\n",
    "It remains to be explained what are the causes that lead to this fact. One possible answer is that it is simply the retelling of many facts that we already know -- e.g., we already know that young men are incarcerated at far higher rates and that incarceration rates vary by geography. While incarceration alone cannot fully explain the clustering by gender, perhaps similar \"known\" facts can, such as residential clustering by industry of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "On plausible path forward would be to build a residential sorting model, perhaps in the style of [Bayer et al (2016)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA10170), and estimate it separately for men and women. "
