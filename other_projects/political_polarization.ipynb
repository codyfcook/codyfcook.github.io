    "The American presidential election 2-stage format requires candidates to obtain their party's nomination in order to compete in the general election against the other party’s nominee. Voters during primary elections tend to hold more extreme views than voters during the general election; many of the more moderate (or disinterested) voters only vote during the more important general election.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format results in shifting incentives for presidential candidates over the election season. During the primary election, candidates can benefit from pandering to their party base – overly centrist candidates may conceal their true ideology in order to appear more in line with the median voter of their party. After securing their party’s nomination, candidates then have an incentive to moderate their platforms to appeal to independent voters and voters on the margin.\n",

    "One of the early frameworks for thinking about party elections is the Hotelling-Downs model of two-party competition [(Downs 1957)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1827369?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). I illustrate in the figure below, in the style of Hotelling-Downs, the motivation for why we may expect candidates in a 2-stage election to adopt a more partisan platform in the primary election and then moderate their platform for the general election. This setup relies on the key assumptions that voter turnout is uniform across the partisan spectrum and that voters have single peaked preferences – that is, that they have a certain bliss point along a single dimension of party platforms and will vote for whatever platform is closet to their bliss point. As illustrated, during the primary the centrist challenger (B) would be set to win the general election; however, a more extreme challenger (A) of the same party is positioned to win the primary. If A were to win the primary, they would then lose the general election. By shifting to position of the median of primary voters, challenger B can win the primary election. However, at his new position he would then lose the general election against the more centrist incumbent. But by again shifting his position, this time to the median general election voter, challenger B can win the general election."

    "For members of Congress, ideology can be estimated by examining roll calls of votes. There is a deep literature in Political Science on how best to turn voting records into estimates of an individuals partisan lean. One of the most popular methods is called DW-NOMINATE, originally developed by [Rosenthal and Poole (1980)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111172?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). Details and estimates for every congress are made available by [Voteview](https://voteview.com/about). \n",

    "Many presidential candidates, however, are not members of Congress. Further, DW-NOMINATE is estimated only infrequently as it requires many votes -- it cannot provide, for example, monthly estimates of someones ideology. If an individual's ideology shifts over time, it will take awhile to show up in DW-NOMINATE scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate candidates DW-NOMINATE scores, without relying on legislative votes, I do the following: \n",
    "1. Collect the text of all speeches given by members of Congress (Senate and House) given on the congressional floor by scraping [Congress's](https://www.congress.gov//) website, which includes transcripts\n",

    "2. Remove stop words (e.g., “a”, “as”, “not”, “of”, ...) according to a list provided by the *nltk* package\n",

    "I model polarization using Multinomial Inverse Regression (MNIR), a relatively new framework for text analysis developed in [Taddy (2013)](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2012.734168) and applied to a similar problem in [Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy](https://www.brown.edu/Research/Shapiro/pdfs/politext.pdf). The MNIR framework allows dimension reduction for text data while preserving estimates of sentiment (in this case, DW-NOMINATE or party affiliation). Further, MNIR accommodates the intrinsic multinomial structure of text; politicians do not iteratively (or independently) choose each phrase in a speech, but rather simultaneously choose a large combination of different phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider count vectors $\\mathbf{x}_i = [x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ip}]^T$ for each document $i$, where $p$ represents the number of bigrams in the representation. Define $m_i \\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}$ to be the total number of bigrams spoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to assume that each $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is independent. In the case of political speeches, that is a difficult assumption to defend given that all documents come from a small set of speakers, such that count vectors are likely to be strongly correlated across documents from the same speaker. I mitigate this by collapsing count vectors by speaker $s$ into a single count vector representing all speech by a given legislator, implicitly assuming that each speaker represents a unique and independent text-generating function: $\\mathbf{x}_s = \\sum_{i: s_i=s}\\mathbf{x}_i\\ \\forall s \\in S$, the set of all speakers. Similarly, $m_s = \\sum_{i: s_i = s} m_i \\ \\forall s \\in S$.\n",

The coefficients $\\gamma_{j}$ and $\\varphi_j$ can be interpreted as the lift in utility from being Republican or having a higher DW-NOMINATE score for speaker $s$ using phrase $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As described, estimation of the above multinomial regression is infeasible due to computational limitations and the high dimensionality of text data; however, it can be approximated using a Poisson approximation, which allows for distributed computing. Details of the Poisson approximation for MNIR can be found in Taddy 2013; I use the corresponding R package *textir* for estimation. The Poisson approximation implementation in *textir* imposes substantial sparsity on loadings through a penalized minimization -- the result is that over half the loadings on bigrams for party affiliation and DW-NOMINATE are zero. This helps limit overfitting. \n",

Rather, the party affiliation results shed light on the significance of the apparently moderate change in DW-NOMINATE scores, which are not generally interpretable in terms of magnitudes or percent decreases (only in comparison to the distribution of other legislators). The party affiliation results suggest that the decrease in DW-NOMINATE corresponds to being almost positive that Romney is Republican ($\\sim 94\\%$) to there being a $\\sim 30\\%$ chance that he is Democrat, based on this speech.
