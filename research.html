                How does the location of affordable housing affect tenant welfare, the distribution of assistance, and broader social objectives such as racial and economic integration? Using administrative data on households living in units funded by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), we first show that affordable housing built in more affluent, 'higher-opportunity' neighborhoods houses tenants that are higher income, have more education, grew up in richer families, and are less likely to be Black or Hispanic. To quantify the welfare implications, we develop and estimate a residential choice model in which households choose from both market-rate and affordable housing options, where the latter must be rationed. Using the model estimates, we show that moving a new development to a higher-opportunity neighborhood increases aggregate tenant welfare and reduces both racial/ethnic and economic segregation, but is more costly to provide and transfers surplus from higher-need, Black, and Hispanic households to more moderate-need, non-Black/Hispanic households. This transfer is primarily due to a 'crowd out' effect: households that will only apply for units in high-opportunity neighborhoods crowd out households willing to apply anywhere. Policy levers available post-construction—such as lowering the income limits used for means-testing—have only limited effects relative to the initial choice of where to build affordable housing.

                  I study how preferences for neighborhood amenities vary by income. Using data on over 150 million visits to restaurants, shops, personal services, and entertainment places, I estimate a model of demand for amenities. I find that higher and lower-income urban residents have heterogeneous preferences for individual establishments, which often vary systematically along observable dimensions such as category, brand, and price level. Using the location and estimated quality of each establishment, I construct an aggregate Neighborhood Amenity Quality Index (NAQI) that measures the value of each neighborhood's overall access to amenities. Despite the heterogeneity in establishment-level preferences, neighborhood-level preferences exhibit a strong positive correlation; higher and lower-income residents generally agree on the quality of a neighborhood's overall access to amenities. Densely populated neighborhoods close to the urban core have especially high-quality access to amenities. Conditional on population density, neighborhoods with better amenity access tend to be richer, more educated, and have more expensive rents.

                  Cities provide access to stores, public amenities and other people, but that access may provide less benefit for lower-income and younger urbanites who lack money and means of easy mobility.  Using detailed GPS location data, we measure the urban mobility and experienced racial and economic isolation of the young and the disadvantaged. We find that students in major metropolitan areas experience more racial and income isolation, spend more time at home, stay closer to home when they do leave, and visit fewer restaurants and retail establishments than adults. Looking across levels of income, students from higher-income families visit more amenities, spend more time outside of the home, and explore more unique locations than low-income students. Combining a number of measures into an index of urban mobility, we find that, conditional on income, urban mobility is positively correlated with home neighborhood characteristics such as distance from the urban core, car ownership, and social capital.

                    We develop and implement a heterogeneous-agents network-based empirical model to analyze alternative policies during a pandemic outbreak. We combine several data sources, including information on individuals' mobility and encounters across metropolitan areas, information on health records for  millions of individuals, and information on the possibility to be productive while working from home. This rich combination of data sources allows us to build a framework in which the severity of a disease outbreak varies across locations and industries, and across individuals who differ by age, occupation, and preexisting health conditions. We use this framework to analyze the impact of different social distancing policies in the context of the COVID-19 outbreaks across US metropolitan areas. Our  results highlight how outcomes vary across areas in relation to the underlying heterogeneity in population density, social network structures, population health, and employment characteristics. We find that policies by which individuals who can work from home continue to do so, or in which schools and firms alternate schedules across different groups of students and employees, can be  effective in limiting the health and healthcare costs of the pandemic outbreak while also reducing employment losses.

                    The growth of the gig economy generates worker flexibility that, some have speculated, will favor women. We explore this by examining labor supply choices and earnings among more than a million rideshare drivers on Uber in the U.S. We document a roughly 7% gender earnings gap amongst drivers. We show that this gap can be entirely attributed to three factors: experience on the platform (learning-by-doing), preferences over where to work (driven largely by where drivers live and, to a lesser extent, safety), and preferences for driving speed. We do not find that men and women are differentially affected by a taste for specific hours, a return to within-week work intensity, or customer discrimination. Our results suggest that there is no reason to expect the gig economy to close gender differences. Even in the absence of discrimination and in flexible labor markets, women's relatively high opportunity cost of non-paid-work time and gender-based differences in preferences and constraints can sustain a gender pay gap.

                        One way for older workers to ease into retirement is to move to the gig economy where they can freely choose hours and intensity of work. We look at age/wage profiles of workers in the traditional labor market and of Uber drivers. While the move to the gig economy generates flexibility, it also moves pay closer to a spot market where individuals earn (presumably) their marginal product. Earnings for workers in traditional jobs increase steeply with age, while Uber earnings are steadily declining after age forty. This highlights the tradeoff between flexible work arrangements and earnings.

                  We study the welfare and distributional effects of dynamically priced highway toll lanes, the predominant form of congestion pricing in the United States today. To quantify the effects of dynamic tolling, we develop and estimate an equilibrium model of highway travel. The demand model features heterogeneous drivers and captures a new welfare channel, the option value of tolling: even drivers who infrequently take the priced lanes can benefit from having the option but not the obligation to pay for speed. On the supply side, travel times are determined by the corridor's road technology and prices are set by a pricing algorithm. We estimate the model using data on toll transactions, historical traffic conditions, and driver characteristics from the I-405 Express Toll Lanes in Washington State. Relative to a world in which the same number of highway lanes are all free, status-quo tolling increases net aggregate welfare by $7,300 per day and benefits drivers in all income quartiles. Drivers in the bottom income quartile gain the most (+$5,500 per day) because they have the longest I-405 commutes and they face low prices relative to their time savings from the priced lanes. The option value of tolling accounts for $5,780 per day in aggregate and partially compensates drivers with short I-405 commutes, who are made worse off. Finally, we show how simple revisions to the pricing algorithm, such as raising the price ceiling and introducing income-based pricing, can increase aggregate welfare and achieve redistributive goals.

                  Unlike many other goods allocated through centralized mechanisms, affordable housing is durable: who receives a unit today affects the supply of units available to reallocate in the future. We build a dynamic model of the allocation mechanism that endogenizes the arrival rate of vacant units. Households in the model make decisions on both whether to apply and, if allocated a unit, whether to move out each period. Policy changes that affect the move-out rate (e.g., giving households more choice when applying or allowing tenants to swap units) lead to a tradeoff between providing longer stays to fewer households or shorter stays to more households. Optimal policy will depend on dynamic considerations, such as how match quality, need, and any treatment effects on households evolve over time. To take the theory to the data, we are working on a data-sharing agreement with New York City, where units are allocated through centrally-run lotteries.
